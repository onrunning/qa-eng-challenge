## Engineer Engineer Use Case

Your team is working on a web shop that sells sporting goods to end customers. To increase conversions a new checkout flow was built and is ready for testing on a staging environment.


### Task
1. Describe a high-level test strategy for the checkout flow the users go through when purchasing from the web shop. You can use a Word document to explain your strategy.
2. Write an example of two test cases. Describing the steps for each scenario to test is enough, no need to implement the spec itself.
3. Write an E2E test for the happy path of the checkout flow (we'd be happy if you use Cypress JS. If you're not comfortable with it, feel free to use another tool you prefer)

You can use our staging environment and the following test data:

- [Staging environment](https://staging-beta.on-running.com)
    - There is basic auth in place to keep out bots, use username: `on` and password: `trend` to gain access
- Test credit card details from [Adyen](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers)


### Notes
- Be prepared to explain decisions you have taken
- We donâ€™t expect you to spend a lot of time on this task. As a guideline, you should not spend more than 8 hours on it. Just hand in what you have by then
- Use this task as a possibility to show off your skills ;-)
